  <h1>Jacob Pride, PhD</h1>
  <p><em><strong><a href="http://mccks.edu/academics/faculty/">English Instructor</a></strong> at Manhattan Christian College
      and <strong><a href="https://www.saintxrams.org/">Religion Teacher</a></strong> at St. Xavier Catholic School</em></p>
  <p>I live in Manhattan, KS with my wife, Caitlin, and my two boys,
    William and Charles, and our first girl, Elsie Grace!
    I joined the pre-theologate program my second semester at Ave Maria University
    and was a member of <a href="http://archive.naplesnews.com/news/education/ave-maria-graduates-first-class-at-new-collier-campus-ep-401743990-344515602.html">AMU's first graduating class</a> at the new campus in 2008.
    I received the St. Thomas Aquinas Award for Balance and Eutropalia
    (probably because I am an Eagle Scout and play the ukulele), and after a year at
    Mount St. Mary’s seminary, I served as a <a href="https://www.focus.org/">FOCUS</a> missionary for two years and met Caitlin.
    We dated while I earned a master’s in English at Georgia Southern University.
    My AMU thesis advisor encouraged me to continue my education and get a PhD in English
    at the University of Denver. Caitlin and I were married in 2013, and I received
    my doctorate in 2017. My dissertation concerns Catholic literary theory and
    Southern Gothic Literature. I taught English at Kansas State University, and
    I now teach theology at St. Francis Xavier High School and English night classes
    at Manhattan Christian College. </p>
